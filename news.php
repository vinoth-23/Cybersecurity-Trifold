		  <p>Use your smarts, and technology, to be cyber-secure – at home, at work, at uni or out in the world.</p>
		  <ol  class='lst'>
		  <li> CHECK IF YOU’VE ALREADY BEEN INVOLVED IN A DATA BREACH</li>
		  <p>Visit haveibeenpwned.com  and change those passwords for any accounts that it suggests may have been compromised</p>
		  
		  <li> CHECK THE STRENGTH OF YOUR PASSWORDS</li>
		  <p>Test the strength of your passwords at howsecureismypassword.net(external link) (use something similar to your original password to test its strength).
When choosing a password, remember: the longer it is, the stronger it is. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and hard to guess. Using a sentence is a great way to create a long password that you’ll never forget.</p>
		  
		  <li> AVOID THESE PASSWORDS</li>
		  <p>The following passwords are considered the most common and easiest to crack – so if you’ve got any of these or similar variations, you should seriously considering changing them – quickly!
</p>
		  <ul class='lst'>
		  <li>
		  123456 (or any chronologically-ordered numbers)</li>
<li>987654321</li>
<li>123123</li>
<li>QWERTY</li>
<li>111111</li>
<li>password</li>
</ul>

		  <li> TRUST NO ONE (ON EMAILS)</li>
		  <p>This may sound a bit extreme – but always be on the lookout for deceitful emails and compromised web pages (spam and phishing). Interacting with these puts your information at risk and can download viruses. Remember:</p>
		 		  <ul class='lst'>
<li>don't open email from unknown email addresses</li>
<li>trash attachments in unexpected emails</li>
<li>avoid risky clicks – instead type the address into your browser.</li>
</ul> 

 <li>SECURE YOUR DEVICE</li>
		  <p>If your mobile device is unsecured, lost or stolen, it could be used to access your info, your money or steal your identity and irreplaceable data like photos or messages. Secure your devices by:</p>
		 	  <ol class='lst'>
<li>installing anti-virus software</li>
<li>setting a password, gesture or fingerprint that must be entered to unlock</li>
<li>setting the device to require a password before applications are installed</li>
<li>leaving Bluetooth hidden when not in use and disabling automatic connection to networks</li>
<li>enabling remote locking and/or wiping functions, if your device supports them.</li>
<li>Use online banking wisely</li>
 <ul class='lst'>
<li>First, you need to periodically review and evaluate the bank’s online policies.</li>
<li>You need to use complex login details. Always change your identification number(PIN). Avoid easy to guess numbers such as year of birth.</li>
<li>Your computer needs to be secured.</li>
<li>Your credit card usage needs to be increased. Credit cards are more secure than debit cards.</li>
<li>Abstain from accessing your accounts from public places. The chances of public monitoring are high. For instance, free wifi and other public networks.</li>
<li>Check your account balance periodically.</li>
<li>Regularly check emails from the bank.</li>
<li>When you suspect an intrusion, take immediate action by contacting the bank.</li>
 </ul>
 
<li>Mitigate cyber threats on mobile phones</li>
 <ul class='lst'>
<li>Choose devices that have an emphasis on security features. Your smartphone must have a file encryption feature. This feature protects devices from malicious apps.</li>
<li>Secure your smartphone through configuration. Enable password feature in your device. Choose a complex password with a combination of characters, symbols, and numerics.</li>
<li>Ensure you are securely connected to the internet by configuring web accounts.</li>
<li>Avoid opening suspicious links and malicious pop-ups.</li>
<li>Avoid sharing your number on public websites.</li>
<li>Choose your apps keenly by doing some research on them before installing and subscribing them.</li>
<li>In case your device gets stolen, take immediate action. Report the incident to the organization and the service provider.</li>
 </ul> 

<li>Use online gaming safely</li>
<p>You need to identify administrator mode risks. Most of the games request for your computer to be in admin mode. This will ensure that the downloaded game is safe and authentic.
Be keen on firewall management. Home users can protect their devices by enabling the firewall to filter what is being accessed.
Play the game on the site it is located to prevent encountering malicious websites and ads.
</p>

<li>Have knowledge of voice over internet protocol (VoIP)</li>
<p>VoIP involves making calls using a broadband connection through the telephone lines. Some risks come with internet telephony called spam. Many telephone users have experienced unnecessary calls and voice messages. In the case of spammers, you can use the Akismet plugin to keep known threats away from your site or device.</p>

<li>Download VPN apps</li>
<p>A VPN creates a secure connection between you and the internet. When you use the internet through a VPN, all your data traffic is sent through an encrypted virtual tunnel.
VPN not only helps you with security but with privacy too, so having one is always a great idea. Choosing the best VPN can be a difficult task so always check if the VPN provides free trial so you can test it out before actually considering it.
VPN is prefered when sending important E-mails. E-mail is also a tool to conduct business. Even though you have better security software on your computer, your partner may not have.

			<p>Here are five steps to help put your organization in the best possible position to defend against cyber threats that lurk online.</p>
			<ol class='lst'>
			<li>Learn how to detect a potential social engineering attack</li>
			<p>Whether in the form of phishing, ransomware, or pretexting — among others — social engineering attacks are dangerous and often hard to pinpoint. The ability to detect them as soon as possible is vital to protecting your organization against such cyber threats.
Every single member of your organization should learn how to detect a potential social engineering attack. All it takes is one employee to click on the wrong link or send personal information to the wrong person, for a large-scale data breach to occur.
Here’s a list of data and communication exchanges that you should think twice about before offering or engaging in:
</p>
<ul class='lst'>
<li>Requests for user or shared credentials</li>
<li>Requests for contractual or financial information</li>
<li>Requests for personal information</li>
<li>Unusual or suspicious links and files</li>
<li>Unusual or suspicious phone calls</li>
</ul>
<li>Educate users on devices</li>
			<p>Genetec cybersecurity device usage best practicesUser education on devices is a straightforward, yet vital step in protecting them. It ensures that every member of your organization is aware of the best practices around protecting your organization data. While this begins at onboarding, educating your employees on how to secure their devices is an ongoing process.
</p>
<p>Whether it be for a 5-minute washroom break or a 10-minute chat with your co-worker, locking your devices before you leave your workstation is an essential starting point since your password acts as the first line of defense.
Refraining from using third-party applications that haven’t been approved by your IT department is also a key factor, as it ensures that you’re not using any vulnerable programs that could be exploited. You should also limit any unnecessary use of personal devices for work. Instead, use the devices made available by your organization to help reduce the risk of a cyber attack.
</p>
<li>Implement multi-factor authentication and password management</li>
			<p>Password management policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are essential when it comes to securing your devices. While a password’s role is straightforward, consistently rotating a strong and randomized password is just as crucial.
It’s important to change all default passwords on your devices, as this is a vulnerability often exploited by threat actors. And of course, never share your passwords — with anyone.
MFA is also key to securing your systems, as it forces the user to confirm their credentials through a secure, secondary application every time a device is used.
</p>

<li>Keep up with software and hardware best practices</li>
			<p>Genetec cybersecurity software update best practiceSoftware and hardware physical security best practices help to ensure that you’re doing all you can to secure your organization, whether it be choosing systems with built-in defense functions or regularly updating your software and hardware.
Choosing systems with built-in layers of defense strengthens your organization’s cybersecurity the minute they’re up and running. With many solutions containing built-in security functions like data encryption and endpoint protection, these obstacles make it harder for threat actors to penetrate your systems.
When it comes to software updates, many overlook the important role that they play in helping to secure your organization. Prioritize updating the software and firmware on all your devices, as this allows them to function at their optimal level. Product updates often provide critical fixes for newfound vulnerabilities.
</p>

<li>Choose the right technology</li>
			<p>Finding a technology provider that offers the solutions you need, all while operating with transparency, is not easy. While it may take time to decide which vendor is the right fit for your organization, it’s an important step towards shaping your ideal security solution.
Most vendors offer their customers hardening guides — guides that provide tips on how to keep your system secure — so ask the right questions to ensure you receive your vendors’ relevant data and privacy protection policies.
Choosing the right technology is central to a strong cybersecurity strategy, as operating with transparency and maintaining clear communication around vulnerabilities allows your organization to create an optimal cybersecurity strategy.
Maintaining your cybersecurity is an ongoing process
With the constant flow of people throughout your organization, especially in the form of new and departing employees, educating each member of your organization on cybersecurity best practices is an endless process.
While it begins at onboarding, both new and existing employees require constant reminders and updates on the steps that they must take, every day, to protect your organization against an evolving number of cyber threats.
